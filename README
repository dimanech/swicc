This is a HTML5-CSS3 blank canvas theme for Drupal 7 based on theme Framework (http://drupal.org/project/framework) with some useful improvements.

This is a lightweight and minimalistic blank canvas theme for Drupal 7.
It is build with HTML 5 and large parts of CSS3, included fluid markup and media queries structure, so you can support mobile devices in one CSS file.
It is based around typography and html, so 1) all in 'em' and dependent on it; 2) out of box styled specific html tags like 'dfn', 'abbr', 'kdb', 'del', 'ins', etc.

it has very little deliberate support for IE6!

Steel in very deep alfa state!

=============================== Usage ==================================

Install to sites/all/themes or sites/all/yoursitename/themes

To fully convert Swicc to your own custom theme, it is encouraged that you:
 - COPY the 'Swicc' directory within sites/all/themes/ and rename it as 'yourthemename'
 - Change the filename and contents of the .info file accordingly and remove all 'packing script' info at the end of the file
 - Use find/replace in template.php to replace 'swicc' with 'yourthemename'
 - Upload and enable the theme
 - Modify as needed

To create a sub-theme based on Framework, see: http://drupal.org/node/225125
