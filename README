   SWICC

   Deveolped by Dmytro Nechepurenko. Distributed by GNU GPL v.2.
   Based on work Andr√© Griffin (http://andregriffin.com).
   Some parts are based on works Stefan Nitzsche, Yahoo UI, and others.

This is a lightweight and minimalistic blank canvas theme for Drupal 7.
It is build on HTML 5 and CSS 3, included fluid markup and media queries structure,
so you can support mobile devices in one CSS file.
It is based around typography and html, so 1) all in 'em' and dependent on it; 2) out of box styled specific html tags like 'dfn','abbr','kdb', 'del', 'ins', etc.

Steel in very deep alfa state!

In future I plan add support for grid structure, Google Rich Snippets, and improve HTML5 markup.

==================== Usage ========================

Install to sites/all/themes or sites/all/yoursitename/themes

To fully convert Swicc to your own custom theme, it is encouraged that you: 
 - COPY the 'Swicc' directory within sites/all/themes/ and rename it as 'yourthemename' 
 - Change the filename and contents of the .info file accordingly and remove all 'packing script' info at the end of the file
 - Use find/replace in template.php to replace 'swicc' with 'yourthemename' 
 - Upload and enable the theme
 - Modify as needed
